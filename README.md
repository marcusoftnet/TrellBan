# Suggestions
* Max leadtime - what's the longest anything ever took
* Min leadtime - what's the shortest anything ever took
* Throughput (number of items completed / unit of time, week for example)
* Cycle time, maybe not for now, since it will be a bit messy to calcule. We have to ask the user for which cycle we're going to measure. You could also just stack it in a Culumnative Flow Diagram (CFD). That's easier to calculate but harder to read.

* I think that we can do a pretty good visualization as well for leadtime like this:
	* plot a diagram with all the leadtimes on a time-axis
	* add an average line
	* add 1 (or 3?) sigma above
	* add 1 (or 3?) sigma below
